  abstract =	 "This paper expands the specification of a set of
                  kernel routines for linear algebra, historically
                  called the Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms and
                  commonly known as the BLAS. Numerical linear
                  algebra, particularly the solution of linear systems
                  of equations, linear least squares problems,
                  eigenvalue problems and singular value problems, is
                  fundamental to most calculations in scientific
                  computing, and is often the computationally intense
                  part of such calculations. Designers of computer
                  programs involving linear algebraic operations have
                  frequently chosen to implement certain low level
                  operations, such as the dot product or the matrix
                  vector product, as separate subprograms. This may be
                  observed both in many published codes and in codes
                  written for specific applications at many computer
                  installations. A major aim of the standards defined
                  in this paper is to enable linear algebra libraries
                  (both public domain and commercial) to interoperate
                  efficiently, reliably and easily.",

                  eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors of a sparse
                  Hermitian matrix of large order $n$. The matrix is
                  accessed only through the evaluation of
                  matrix-vector products. Working space of only a few
                  $n$-vectors is required. The program implements a
                  restarted block-Lanczos method. Judicious choices of
                  acceleration polynomials make it possible to compute
                  approximations of a few of the largest eigenvalues,
                  a few of the smallest eigenvalues, or a few
                  eigenvalues in the vicinity of a user-specified
                  point on the real axis. irbleigs also can be applied
                  to certain large generalized eigenproblems as well
                  as to the computation of a few nearby singular
                  values and associated right and left singular
                  vectors of a large general matrix.",
